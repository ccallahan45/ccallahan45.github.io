title: "About Me"
---

I am a PhD student at Dartmouth College in the EEES program, working with Dr. Justin Mankin. My primary interest is in using observations and numerical models of the climate system to understand and project the consequences of anthropogenic climate change. My undergraduate degree is in environmental science, from Northwestern University in Evanston, IL.

My previous work focused on the consequences of climate change and climate variability for the atmospheric stagnation patterns responsible for poor air quality in Beijing. My future work is evolving to integrate analysis of climate variability and econometric methods to connect the physical climate system to explicit, rigorous quantifications of the environment-human relationship.
